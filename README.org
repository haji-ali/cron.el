* Introduction

=cron.el= is an emulator of cron for Emacs. It has functionality to schedule
function calls at specific time points, following a cron expression.

* Configuration
You can call the function =cron-schedule= to schedule a function call at
specific times. For example, the following function call schedules a message
starting with the third second then every five seconds in the 3rd to 10th
minute every hour, every day, every month and every year.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq cron-test-timer
        (cron-schedule "2/5 5-10"
                       (lambda () (message "%s cron fired"
                                           (format-time-string "%T %d/%m/%Y")))))

  ;; To cancel the cron timer, simply do
  (cancel-timer cron-test-timer)
#+end_src

A cron expression consists of up to 7 parts, ~SECONDS MINUTES HOURS DAY MONTH WEEKDAY YEAR~.
For example, ~0/5 14,18,20-39,52 * * JAN,MAR,SEP MON-FRI 2002-2050~.

For more complicated cron expressions, see [[https://www.netiq.com/documentation/cloud-manager-2-5/ncm-reference/data/bexyssf.html][here]] for the format.

* Why?

Mostly because I got interested in efficient ways computing cron trigger times
given an expression. Let me know if you have better methods.
